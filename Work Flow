1. WEBCAM INITIALIZATION: 
 
Firstly, the webcam is initialized by using “cv2.vVdeoCapture” function. The 
argument is set to “0” which means it uses the default camera (normally the webcam 
connected to the system) for the capturing of the video. 
 
2. FRAME ACQUISITION: 
 
After the capturing of image the frames of the images are continuously read from the 
webcam feed using “cap.read()” function. This function retrieves the latest frame 
from the webcam and returns two values: a Boolean indicating whether the frame was 
successfully captured (ret) and the captured frame itself (frame).  
 
3. FACE DETECTION: 
 
Once a frame is obtained, computer vision techniques are applied to detect faces 
within the frame. The OpenCV library provides a “CascadeClassifier” class, which is 
pre-trained with a cascade classifier for face detection. This classifier is capable of 
identifying facial features within the frame, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, to 
determine the presence and location of faces. 
 
4. FACE IMAGE CAPTURE: 
 
After detecting a face within the frame, the code captures the face image by isolating 
the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the detected face. The coordinates (x, y, 
width, height) of the bounding box around the detected face are extracted from the 
face detection results. Using these coordinates, the face image is cropped from the 
original frame to isolate the face region. 
 
5. IMAGE PROCESSING: 
 
The captured face image may undergo additional preprocessing steps to enhance its 
quality or prepare it for further analysis. Common preprocessing steps may include 
converting the image to grayscale, resizing it to a specific dimension, or applying 
image enhancement techniques to improve clarity.
